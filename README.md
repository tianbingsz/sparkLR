## Efficient yet Simple SparkLR Machine Learning Training Algorithms and Systems.

### Core Methodologies
* Problem: Image Search Ads CTR (click-through-rate) prediction with queries/clicks and images.
* Adopted Distributed Conjugate Gradient algorithm on Spark Distributed Computing Framework.
* Developped fast and accuracte End-to-End Logistic Regression Training Pipelines from raw data to model to prediction.

### Performance (Scalability and Accuracy)
* A highly scalable Machine Learning training systems deployed on 100+ machines for 10+ TeraBytes data.  
* 10X speedup with much more better test accuracy compared to MLLib SGD
* Achieved near production AUC accuracy (on real online traffic testing) with much less number of machines.
